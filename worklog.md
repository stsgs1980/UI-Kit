Work Log:
- Cloned Component-Browser-Public-v1.0 repo
- Found 40 layout components in reusable_components/layout/
- Analyzed all 40 files via subagent: identified 12 unique layout patterns

- Added LayoutStructure type (38 pattern names) to types.ts
- Added layout tokens to tokens.ts (5 container sizes, 3 sidebar widths, 6 gap sizes, 5 breakpoint columns)
- Created 8 UI primitives:
  1. Grid + GridItem: responsive CSS Grid with named gaps, colSpan/rowSpan
  2. Container: max-width wrapper with named sizes
  3. Stack: vertical/horizontal flex stack
  4. Cluster: wrapping horizontal flex (tags, actions)
  5. ColumnBrowser: N-column master-detail (generalizes 001+006)
  6. SearchableFilterableGrid: search + tabs + responsive grid (from 035)
  7. BentoGrid + BentoItem: variable-size grid with span

Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix multi-goal scoring for "SaaS лендинг с дашбордом" returning Container Query Grid

Work Log:
- Analyzed scoring for "SaaS лендинг с дашбордом": goalWeights={saas:0.222, landing:0.389, dashboard-app:0.389}
- Root cause 1: container-query-grid has bestFor=['saas','dashboard-app','crm'] giving +25 each, but no structural features (no header/sidebar/footer)
- Root cause 2: dashboard/sidebar-left layouts conflict with 'landing' (-35 penalty), destroying their multi-goal score
- Root cause 3: needsSidebar was false (derived from primary goal 'landing' only), ignoring dashboard-app's sidebar need
- Root cause 4: contentType was 'cards' instead of 'mixed' for multi-goal prompts
- Fixed parsePrompt: multi-goal sets contentType='mixed', needsSidebar from secondary goals (weight>0.15), weighted itemCount defaults
- Fixed scoreLayoutMulti: conflict penalty restored proportionally to non-conflicting goals (up to 70%), structural adequacy penalty (-8 per missing feature), synergy bonus (+3-8), versatility bonus (+4), critical miss penalty (-12)
- Fixed AI mode: always runs keyword parser alongside to get goalWeights
- Updated all 3 variant components to use scoreLayoutMulti for multi-goal
- Added "SaaS лендинг с дашбордом" to PROMPT_EXAMPLES
- Pushed to GitHub: commit 86208e0

Stage Summary:
- Holy Grail now wins for "SaaS лендинг с дашбордом" (~77) over Container Query Grid (~57)
- Structural adequacy penalty: -8 per missing sidebar/header/footer in multi-goal
- Conflict mitigation: layouts conflicting with 1 of 3 goals no longer destroyed
- Multi-goal structural inference: sidebar enabled when any significant goal needs it

Task: Study reference products (21st.dev, UI UX Pro Max, Google Stitch) and define Studio Vision

Work Log:
- Fetched and analyzed https://21st.dev: component marketplace + AI agent registry, React/Tailwind copy-paste, agent SDK
- Fetched and analyzed https://ui-ux-pro-max-skill.nextlevelbuilder.io: 57 styles, 95 palettes, 56 font pairings, AI recommendations by context
- Fetched and analyzed https://stitch.withgoogle.com: Gemini 2.5 Pro AI UI generator, prompt/sketch -> mockup + code
- Previously studied https://loadingui.space.z.ai: loading/skeleton state showcase

- Proposed solution: [data-theme] CSS selectors + per-theme CSS files + @theme inline mapping
- Discussed scalability: what if 20 presets? Proposed registry pattern (Map<string, PresetDefinition>) vs closed union type
- User reframed the entire project: not a "theme switcher" but an "Interface Studio"
- Defined 3 engines: Layout (done), Theme (next), Component (future)
- Identified critical distinction: studio colors vs project colors (dual theme system)
- Created docs/planning/studio-vision.md capturing ALL decisions and discussion history
